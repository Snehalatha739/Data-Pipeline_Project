This project demonstrates a simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** data pipeline built using Python.

The pipeline:
1. **Extracts** product data from a public API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
2. **Transforms** it by renaming columns, converting prices, and cleaning nested JSON
3. **Loads** the final clean data into an SQLite database (`store.db`)
